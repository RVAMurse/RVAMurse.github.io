My poor abused hands.

The most repugnant thing about Nursing as a career (apart from massive GI bleeds and Golytely) is the state of your hands in the winter. Generally I can make it through the summer with my skin intact but by January there are at least several large spots of angry red eczema that make every foam in and foam out a misery. That leads to a vicious cycle of steroids and fastidious moisturizing until temps and humidity rise.

Over the years I've tried to approach skin care as if it were any other chronic condition largely influenced by life style choices, like DM II. I've learned a lot about what works for me. Here's what I've found.

As with any chronic condition that is caused at least in part by life style you should try and rid yourself of the offending behaviors or causative agents first. This is particularly difficult for nurses and dry hands because hand hygiene is part of everything we do. I've tried to count the number of times I wash my hands in one twelve hour shift (I plan on starting a log that I will post at a later date) and the number is staggering. Let's just consider intentional hourly rounding. You check on each patient (pt) every hour for twelve hours. I'm an ICU nurse so I generally have 2 pts. You foam in every time you enter a room and foam out every time you leave so that's twelve * 2 per pt. so for 2 pts that's a minimum of 48 hand hygiene events per shift. If you are a tele nurse that's 96 minimum. If you're a med surg nurse that's 24*6 or 144. Now as any ICU nurse will tell  you we enter each pts room way more than once per hour, I'm washing my hands at minimum 100 times a night. On top of foaming in and out we are also supposed to wash our hands when:

- Changing gloves
- Switching from a dirty to a clean task
- Before and after dressing changes
- Before and after touching invasive lines

If you can't escape the causative agents the next step is to mitigate the harm caused as much as possible by making as many life style changes as you can and filling in the gaps with treatment. I've struggled with eczema from a very young age so nursing was probably not the ideal career choice for me, (I probably should have stayed behind the lab bench) but hey what nurse doesn't question their career decision at some point in time. So I've been on topical steroids for large chunks of my life. But steroids are part cure and part poison and really should be used as little as feasible. While not as harmful as taking systemic steroids topical steroids with prolonged use can lead to skin thinning and stretch marks (1). Now I'm hoping I make it to a ripe old age of like 90+ and if you've ever seen a 90 year olds skin it's pretty horrible without any help so skin thinning is a no go for me! So you'd do well to keep your skin as moist as possible so that you can avoid steroid use as much as possible. 

That leads us to moisturizers. Every nurse has their own personal favorite moisturizer however most of them are terrible for your skin especially if you have eczema. Why? There are several reasons the important ones are classification, base and fragrances. First classification, you've probably heard of several different kinds of topical treatments for dry skin these include but are not limited to: 

- lotions
- Creams
- Unguents
- Ointments

The differences between these treatments are viscosity and composition. From top to bottom viscosity increases. Lotions are oil and water based with or without alcohol (2). Alcohol is a no no it's drying and irritating to skin. We hear this again and again in the EBP coming out for skin preps most recently I've read about the evils of alcohol in the new guidance for alarm fatigue management, instead of using alcohol to cleanse skin before electrode placement we are now supposed to use soap and water as the powers that be recognize that prolonged and frequent contact with alcohol is bad for the skin, of course that doesn't stop them from requiring us to use it 100+ times a shift. Creams have a higher viscosity with less water and more waxes and oils. Unguents are similar to ointments but feature more oil (3). Ointments are mostly oil and waxes and no water. Ointments are best for maintaining moisture in skin by producing an occlusive barrier between the skin and the environment. 

So you want an ointment without alcohol in its base what about fragrances? Generally stay away from fragrances. Fragrances can be irritating to skin especially with frequent use. In the case of eczema which is a chronic inflammatory condition likely featuring an autoimmune component constantly exposing your skin to irritants is only going to increase the severity of your condition over time.

What about composition? What kinds of ingredients do you want? This section involves a heavy dose of my own personal opinions so reader beware. Waxes and oils are all lipids. Lipids are hydrocarbons meaning they are large organic molecules with chains of carbon bonded with hydrogen and can be saturated generally forming solids or unsaturated generally forming liquids. So there are all kinds of lipids you can use for emollients. There are the plant based lipids these are your butters, Shea, coconut etc. all expensive and hard to come by. There are animal based lipids including my favorite, lanolin, which is a wax formed in the sebaceous glands of wool bearing animals it's what makes wool smell like sheep. Then there's good old fashioned petrolatum. Petrolatum is a byproduct of crude oil. That doesn't sound too appealing but it's widely available, cheap and according to many dermatologists the best thing you can use to prevent and treat dry hands. Discovered in 1859 we've had a long time to use and study petrolatum or petroleum jelly. There's a great Wikipedia article on petrolatum (4). Some other ingredients you will see on the backs of packages: 

- Glycerol - the hub of all triglycerides, it's an alcohol that attracts water from its surroundings and is used to hydrate skin. It can be isolated from plants or produced industrially.
- Dimethicone - found in many patient facing skin protectants in the hospital such as wipes and creams. It's a silicone polymer produced industrially and is not naturally occurring.

What ingredients to I prefer / look for? I'm a fan of petrolatum / lanolin based creams, unguents and ointments. They are the oldest, most widely studied and usually the simplest in composition. Some of the dimethicone / glycerol based moisturizers are also good. 

What specific products do I use? See the image below. I started my nursing career using the old standbys like gold bond. After I found out those weren't the most effective due to alcohol content, low viscosity and fragrance use I changed strategy and product choice a bit. I moved onto the glycerin based Neutrogena hand cream (Norwegian formula) although it's actually an ointment not a cream. Still not satisfied I used O'Keefs Working hands on and off for along time. However the witches brew that is O'Keefs never sat well with me. It does a great job at relieving the redness and irritation on my hands but I've since moved on. I'm currently using petroleum based ointments, I have a lot of tattoos and so Aquaphor was an early favorite I've recently started using Bag Balm which is a mix of petrolatum and lanolin it's an old recipe (1899) with few ingredients. It smells like sheep but I love the smell of wool so it doesn't bother me. Also it comes in a cool tin.

How do I use these products? Ointments are expensive and greasy so I don't use them at work. You'd have to wash your hands three times at least to get the greasy feeling to go away. So while I'm at work I minimize using alcohol foams as much as possible. This means I spend a lot of time at the sink. I use the hospital provided moisturizer found next to the sink after every hand washing. This is the most important point I can make MOISTURIZER after every hand washing while at work. Just moisturizing between every hand washing will do the most to keep redness and irritation to a minimum. However in my case if all I do is moisturize between hand washing after three shifts I'm worse off from an irritation standpoint than when I started the week. So immediately after report I collect my things and the very last thing I do before stepping off the unit is stop by the last sink wash my hands thoroughly and then apply a thick coating of Aquaphor or Bag Balm. I keep a rag in my backpack so I can remove the ointment from the insides of my hands so I don't leave a greasy trail everywhere I go. On my days off I begin an end my day with a thick layer of the same and sometimes apply throughout the day. I also try to minimize hand washing while off work and when I do wash my hands I try as hard as I can to use gentle glycerin based bars of soap. I NEVER use alcohol based foams or gels while off work. NO PURELL. EVER. Unfortunately this means that I spend most of my time off as a greasy mess but hey it's better than having hands that look like they belong on s Zombie. 

Hope this helps. Stay safe and healthy fellow nurses!
